# Fulla: Real-Time Consumption Monitoring

Fulla is an innovative project developed during the TI-5 course at PUC Minas. Its main goal is to monitor and provide real-time information about the consumption of food and other household goods.

## How It Works

Fulla is a smart jar that measures the quantity of stored groceries and sends this data to an app in real-time. This allows you to track your product consumption directly from your smartphone, making it easier to manage your household inventory and reduce waste.

## Project Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Receive instant updates on the quantity of groceries.
- **App Integration**: Track consumption through a dedicated app.
- **Ease of Use**: Intuitive and easy-to-configure interface.

During the project, a prototype was developed using an old paint jar as a base, but it was eventually lost over time.
