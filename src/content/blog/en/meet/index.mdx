**WebRTC** is a technology that enables real-time communication between browsers. With it, you can make video calls, audio calls, and screen sharing without the need for plugins or extensions.

## Introduction

This project was developed after a practical activity in the **Software Engineering** course. The goal was to create a group video call system using **WebRTC** technology.

The original work is no longer available, but I decided to create a simpler version, focusing only on group video calls to make it accessible.
