## Introduction

This project was developed for a beverage distributor to manage inventory, sales, customers, and suppliers efficiently.

The distributor handles a large number of products, customers, and suppliers, making manual control very challenging. The system was designed to streamline the management of this data, making the process more efficient and organized.

Additionally, there are several distributor units, each requiring individual management but also allowing communication between them. We implemented a per-tenant DB model, where each distributor has its own database.
