A Swift application designed for quizzes in geography, mathematics, and languages. The app provides an interactive platform for users to test their knowledge and improve their skills in these subjects.

The app was developed for the [PUC-MG HackaTruck 2023](https://hackatruck.com.br/), a hackathon sponsored by IBM, Apple, and others.

The project's code is available in this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/andre-brandao/curiosamente).
